# Post Update Script Examples
This repo is an entire demo Drupal 8 site with an Update Script demo module ready to use.

You can pull this repo and use the Lando yml to setup your site. 

Once you get everything setup, turn on the `post_update_demo` module and run `drush updb` or `lando drush updb` if you're using Lando.
You should get a new page with several paragraphs added as well as taxonomy terms.
